Available variables in package Makefile:

mkr-pkgdir: package directory in mkrootfs tree
mkr-deps: package makefile dependencies, in order to trigger a re-configure
if these options change
mkr-srcdir: package source directory


Kconfig additions:
"package" should be used instead of "bool" to mark the configure option for a
package, this has several effects:
- the Makefile for building the corresponding package is taken in the directory where is the Kconfig file containing this option;
- the depencies between these types of options are used as build dependencies for the corresponding packages.

"srcdir" can be used instead of "string" to mark the configure option for a
package source directory.  The value is concatenated to the MKR_SRC_BASEDIR if 
it is a relative path, or is used as path if it is absoute.
