Available variables in package Makefile:

pkgdir: package directory in mkrootfs tree
deps: package makefile dependencies, in order to trigger a re-configure
if these options change
srcdir: package source directory


Kconfig additions:
"package" should be used instead of "bool" to mark the configure option for a
package, this has several effects:
- the Makefile for building the corresponding package is taken in the directory where is the Kconfig file containing this option;
- the build system recurses in this sub-directory if the option is
enabled.

"srcdir" can be used instead of "string" to mark the configure option for a
package source directory.  The value is concatenated to the MKR_SRC_BASEDIR if
it is a relative path, or is used as path if it is absoute, and is
used and used as a pattern glob.

If a Kconfig variable depends or select an option in another
directory's Kconfig, this dependency is used as a build dependency
between the corresponding directories.
